# Corewar
In this 1984 game, Warrior programs written in the assembly language called Redcode will fight each other in a virtual arena.
An exercise in writing:

- A VM (which will host the game as well as act as the jury) with instructions it recognizes, registers, etc.
- An assembler to translate Redcode into bytecode.
- Some warriors to fight in the arena.
