Warrior programs written in Redcode will fight each other in a virtual arena. An exercise in writing: A VM (which will host the game a well as act as the jury) with instructions it recognizes, registers, etc., writing an assembler to translate Redcode into bytecode, and writing some warriors to fight in the arena.
